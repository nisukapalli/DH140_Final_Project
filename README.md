## Data and Visualization of Interest

https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/18/5/544/829676

This article interests me because it relates to a field I would like to explore as a career. As a computer science major and Spanish minor, I feel natural language processing is a relevant and applicable field that combines technology with linguistics and humanities.

I would like to know how to make scatterplots with colored stripes indicating percentiles, and how to make the axes centered on median values.


## Ideas for Data to Investigate

1. 
  * Linguistics
  * International relations


2. The topic that most appeals to me is stats and modeling because it is something I have had some experience in, and I would like to become more proficient. I want to pursue sports data analytics as a career, and I am interested in learning how to make informed predictions and arguments.

## Ideas from Curated Datasets and Project Lists

|Dataset|Description|Link|
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----:|
|Poker Hand|This dataset includes records of possible poker hands. I might investigate the probabilities of winning a poker hand based on the card distributions. |https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand|
|Drug Consumption (quantified)|This dataset includes personal attributes for almost 2000 respondents, as well as information regarding their use of various drugs. I might investigate any possible correlations between a particular drug and certain attributes such as age and ethnicity.|https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29|
